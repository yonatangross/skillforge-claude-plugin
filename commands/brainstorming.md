# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Load and follow the skill instructions from the `skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md` file.

Execute the `/skf:brainstorming` workflow to:
1. **Phase 1 - Understanding**: Ask questions one at a time to gather purpose, constraints, success criteria
2. **Phase 2 - Exploration**: Propose 2-3 different architectural approaches with trade-offs
3. **Phase 3 - Design Presentation**: Present complete design in 200-300 word sections for validation

## Principles
- One question at a time
- Use AskUserQuestion for choices
- Apply YAGNI ruthlessly
- Always propose 2-3 alternatives
- Validate incrementally
- Go backward when needed

## Arguments
- Topic/idea: The rough idea to refine (e.g., "user dashboard", "notification system")
