# Video Hook Formulas

Master the art of the first 3 seconds - proven patterns that stop the scroll and capture attention.

## Why Hooks Matter

- **47%** of video value is delivered in the first 3 seconds
- **65%** of viewers who watch the first 3 seconds will watch at least 10 more
- Hooks determine algorithmic reach on every platform

## The Hook Framework

### Anatomy of a Perfect Hook

```
[PATTERN] + [SPECIFICITY] + [TENSION] = Scroll-stopping hook
```

1. **Pattern**: Use a proven formula (see patterns below)
2. **Specificity**: Add concrete numbers, names, or details
3. **Tension**: Create curiosity gap or emotional response

## 12 Proven Hook Patterns

### 1. The Shocking Statistic

**Formula**: "[Surprising number] + [unexpected context]"

**Examples**:
- "90% of Claude Code users are writing code wrong"
- "This one setting saves 4 hours per week"
- "Only 3% of developers know this exists"

**When to use**: Product features, productivity tips, industry insights

---

### 2. The Transformation Hook

**Formula**: "I went from [bad state] to [good state] in [timeframe]"

**Examples**:
- "I went from manual deploys to zero-downtime in 20 minutes"
- "My code reviews went from 2 hours to 15 minutes"
- "From 50 errors to zero - here's what changed"

**When to use**: Before/after demos, tool adoption stories

---

### 3. The Contrarian Statement

**Formula**: "[Common belief] is wrong. Here's why..."

**Examples**:
- "Writing tests first is actually slower. Let me explain."
- "Stop using ChatGPT for code. Here's what works better."
- "AI won't replace developers. It'll replace THIS instead."

**When to use**: Thought leadership, challenging status quo

---

### 4. The Direct Question

**Formula**: "[Pain point question]?" or "What if [desired outcome]?"

**Examples**:
- "Tired of debugging the same errors every week?"
- "What if your AI assistant actually understood your codebase?"
- "Why does every PR review feel like a fight?"

**When to use**: Problem-aware audiences, relatable pain points

---

### 5. The "Stop Doing This" Hook

**Formula**: "Stop [common practice] immediately"

**Examples**:
- "Stop writing console.log for debugging"
- "Stop copying code from ChatGPT directly"
- "Stop reviewing PRs without this checklist"

**When to use**: Common mistakes, bad habits, quick wins

---

### 6. The Secret/Hidden Hook

**Formula**: "The [hidden/secret] [thing] that [benefit]"

**Examples**:
- "The hidden Claude feature that 10x'd my productivity"
- "A secret prompt pattern that actually works"
- "The debugging trick seniors don't share"

**When to use**: Insider knowledge, exclusive tips

---

### 7. The "Most People" Hook

**Formula**: "Most [audience] [mistake]. Here's what to do instead."

**Examples**:
- "Most devs use AI wrong. Here's the right way."
- "Most teams waste 40% of their standup time"
- "Most prompts fail because of this one word"

**When to use**: Positioning expertise, common mistakes

---

### 8. The Countdown/List Hook

**Formula**: "[Number] [things] that [outcome]"

**Examples**:
- "3 commands that replaced 10 tools in my workflow"
- "5 AI skills every developer needs in 2024"
- "7 signs your code review process is broken"

**When to use**: Listicles, quick tips, comprehensive guides

---

### 9. The Story Hook

**Formula**: "[Time marker], [dramatic situation]..."

**Examples**:
- "Last week, our production database crashed at 2am..."
- "I almost got fired over this PR..."
- "3 months ago, I couldn't write a single test..."

**When to use**: Case studies, personal experiences, lessons learned

---

### 10. The "What If" Hook

**Formula**: "What if [desirable outcome] was possible?"

**Examples**:
- "What if AI could write your tests automatically?"
- "What if every PR came with a security audit?"
- "What if debugging took seconds instead of hours?"

**When to use**: Product demos, vision casting, problem-solution

---

### 11. The Challenge Hook

**Formula**: "I [challenged myself/tried] [difficult thing]"

**Examples**:
- "I tried to ship a feature using only AI for a week"
- "I challenged myself to write zero manual tests"
- "I deleted all my dotfiles and started fresh"

**When to use**: Experiments, reviews, journey content

---

### 12. The Authority Hook

**Formula**: "[Credential/Achievement] taught me [insight]"

**Examples**:
- "After 1000+ code reviews, I learned this pattern"
- "Building 50 AI tools taught me one thing"
- "10 years of debugging led me to this workflow"

**When to use**: Establishing credibility, sharing expertise

---

## Hook Intensity Levels

Match hook intensity to platform and audience:

| Level | Intensity | Best For | Example |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Informative | LinkedIn, YouTube | "Here's how to set up..." |
| 2 | Curious | YouTube, Twitter | "This feature changes everything" |
| 3 | Provocative | TikTok, Reels | "Your AI workflow is broken" |
| 4 | Controversial | TikTok, Twitter | "Stop using [popular tool]" |

---

## Hook + Content Alignment

### The Promise-Deliver Rule

Your hook makes a promise. Your content must deliver.

**Good alignment**:
- Hook: "3 commands that save 2 hours daily"
- Content: Actually shows 3 specific commands with real time savings

**Bad alignment**:
- Hook: "This will 10x your productivity"
- Content: Generic tips anyone could find

### The Specificity Principle

More specific hooks perform better:

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "This tool is amazing" | "This tool found 47 bugs in my PR" |
| "Save time with AI" | "Cut code review time by 73%" |
| "Better debugging" | "Debug any error in under 60 seconds" |

## OrchestKit-Specific Hook Examples

### For Skill Demos

**brainstorming skill**:
- "I used to plan features in my head. Here's why that's dangerous."
- "This AI brainstorming pattern caught 3 edge cases I missed"

**review-pr skill**:
- "My PR reviews went from 45 minutes to 8 minutes"
- "7 things this AI catches that humans miss"

**implement skill**:
- "I gave AI one sentence. It built this entire feature."
- "Watch AI implement a feature I quoted 2 weeks for"

### For Agent Demos

**Security Agent**:
- "This AI found a vulnerability I've had for 6 months"
- "Stop shipping insecure code. This catches everything."

**Test Agent**:
- "Zero to 100% test coverage in one command"
- "I haven't written a test manually in 3 weeks"

### For Plugin Features

**Task Management**:
- "My AI assistant tracks its own tasks now"
- "Never lose context mid-feature again"

**Memory System**:
- "This AI remembers decisions from 6 months ago"
- "Context that persists across sessions. Finally."

## Hook Writing Checklist

Before finalizing your hook, verify:

- [ ] **Under 3 seconds** - Can be read/heard in 3 seconds
- [ ] **One idea** - Single, clear concept
- [ ] **Specific** - Contains numbers, names, or concrete details
- [ ] **Tension** - Creates curiosity or emotional response
- [ ] **Deliverable** - Content can fulfill the promise
- [ ] **Platform-appropriate** - Matches platform's intensity norms

## Common Hook Mistakes

### 1. The Vague Hook
**Bad**: "This tool is really helpful"
**Good**: "This tool caught 12 bugs in my last PR"

### 2. The Overpromise
**Bad**: "This will change your life forever"
**Good**: "This changed how I start every coding session"

### 3. The Slow Start
**Bad**: "So today I wanted to talk about..."
**Good**: "Your git workflow is costing you 3 hours a week"

### 4. The Clickbait Without Payoff
**Bad**: "You won't BELIEVE what this AI does" (then shows basic feature)
**Good**: "Watch this AI refactor 500 lines in 30 seconds" (then shows it)
