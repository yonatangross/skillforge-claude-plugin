## TikTok Hooks

### Platform Characteristics

- **Swipe-happy audience**: 0.5 seconds to stop the scroll
- **Sound ON culture**: Audio hooks are powerful
- **Text overlay expected**: Viewers scan visually first
- **Algorithm favors**: Watch time, replays, shares

### TikTok Hook Rules

**Rule 1: Start mid-action**
Don't introduce, don't set up. Start in the middle of the interesting part.

```
❌ "Hey everyone, today I want to show you something cool about AI"
✅ [Screen showing code being written by AI] "Watch it write this entire function"
```

**Rule 2: Visual-first hooks**
The first frame must be visually arresting:
- Unexpected code pattern
- Before/after split
- Facial expression (shock, excitement)
- Text overlay with hook

**Rule 3: Pattern interrupts**
Break expectations immediately:
```
"This looks wrong. But it works perfectly."
"Everyone says don't do this. I do it daily."
```

**Rule 4: Use trending sounds strategically**
- Match sound energy to content energy
- Use sound as pattern interrupt
- Original sounds work for educational content

### TikTok Hook Templates

```
"POV: [relatable developer situation]"
"Tell me you're a [developer] without telling me"
"Things I wish I knew before [common activity]"
"No way this actually works... wait what"
"Why is nobody talking about this?"
```

### OrchestKit for TikTok

## YouTube Shorts Hooks

### Platform Characteristics

- **Slightly more patience**: 1-2 seconds before skip
- **Mixed sound culture**: Many watch muted
- **Discovery-focused**: Algorithm pushes new creators
- **Cross-over from long-form**: Viewers expect substance

### YouTube Shorts Hook Rules

**Rule 1: Text + Voice combo**
Assume some viewers are muted:
```
[Text on screen]: "Your code review is costing you 3 hours/week"
[Voice]: "And here's exactly how to fix it"
```

**Rule 2: Promise clear value**
YouTube viewers expect to learn something:
```
"In the next 45 seconds, you'll learn [specific skill]"
"Watch me [achieve outcome] in under a minute"
```

**Rule 3: Thumbnail frame matters**
First frame often becomes thumbnail. Make it count:
- Clear text overlay
- Expressive face (if face cam)
- Intriguing visual

**Rule 4: End with subscription hook**
Build library value:
```
"Follow for more [category] tips"
"Part 2 drops tomorrow"
```

### YouTube Shorts Hook Templates

```
"[X] seconds to [learn/achieve something specific]"
"The [tool/feature] trick nobody showed you"
"Watch me [do impressive thing] in real-time"
"Here's why your [thing] isn't working"
"Quick tip that took me [time] to discover"
```

### OrchestKit for YouTube Shorts

```
"60 seconds to parallel AI agents. Watch this."
[Demo of review-pr with 6 agents]

"Your AI assistant forgets everything. Unless..."
[Show memory system in action]

"One command. Six agents. Zero context-switching."
[Speed demo of multi-agent workflow]
```

## YouTube Long-Form Hooks

### Platform Characteristics

- **More hook time**: 3-5 seconds before decision
- **Thumbnail critical**: Click-through drives views
- **Watch time is king**: Retention matters most
- **Invested viewers**: They chose to click

### YouTube Long-Form Hook Rules

**Rule 1: Hook-thumbnail synergy**
Hook and thumbnail should work together:
```
Thumbnail: "I Stopped Using [Popular Tool]"
Hook: "After 3 years with [tool], I'm done. Here's what I use now."
```

**Rule 2: The double-hook pattern**
Hook 1 (0-5s): Stop the scroll
Hook 2 (5-30s): Earn the watch

```
Hook 1: "This one setting cost me 40 hours last month"
Hook 2: "I'm going to show you exactly which setting, why it matters,
         and how to fix it in under 5 minutes. Let's start with..."
```

**Rule 3: Timestamp previews**
In the first 30 seconds, preview what's coming:
```
"By the end of this video, you'll know:
 - How to [X]
 - Why [Y] doesn't work
 - The exact settings I use"
```

**Rule 4: Credibility establishment**
Longer format allows for authority hooks:
```
"After reviewing 1000+ PRs at [company], I've found a pattern..."
```

### YouTube Long-Form Hook Templates

```
"[Dramatic statement]. And I'm going to prove it."
"I tested [thing] for [time period]. Here are my results."
"Everything you know about [topic] is wrong. Let me explain."
"[Number] [things] I wish I knew [time] ago"
"The complete guide to [topic] nobody made"
```

### OrchestKit for YouTube Long-Form

```
"I replaced 7 developer tools with one Claude plugin.
Here's my setup after 30 days."
[Full workflow tour and review]

"163 AI skills for developers: The ones that actually matter"
[Curated skill showcase with real examples]

"Parallel AI agents changed how I code. Full breakdown."
[Deep dive into agent orchestration]
```

## LinkedIn Hooks

### Platform Characteristics

- **Professional context**: Career/business focus
- **Text-first**: Most video plays muted
- **Scrolling during work**: Quick consumption
- **Engagement focus**: Comments boost reach

### LinkedIn Hook Rules

**Rule 1: Lead with insight, not hype**
LinkedIn audiences are skeptical of clickbait:
```
❌ "This will BLOW YOUR MIND 🤯"
✅ "We changed one thing in our workflow. It saved 4 hours/week."
```

**Rule 2: Professional specificity**
Add business context:
```
"At [Company], we faced [specific problem]..."
"After leading [X] teams, I've learned..."
```

**Rule 3: Controversy with class**
Challenge norms professionally:
```
"Unpopular opinion: Code review meetings are a waste of time"
"Hot take: Most AI tools create more problems than they solve"
```

**Rule 4: Text overlay is mandatory**
Assume muted viewing. Caption everything.

### LinkedIn Hook Templates

```
"[Company/Team] stopped doing [common practice]. Here's why."
"[X] lesson from [Y] years in [role/industry]"
"We were wrong about [assumption]. Here's what we learned."
"The [practice] playbook that transformed our team"
"[Number] signals your [process] needs fixing"
```

### OrchestKit for LinkedIn

```
"Our team stopped doing manual code review.
AI agents handle it now. Results after 90 days:"
[Case study format with metrics]

"After 1000+ automated PR reviews, here's what AI actually catches:"
[Professional breakdown with data]

"I was skeptical about AI coding assistants.
Then I tried skill-based orchestration."
[Professional testimonial format]
```

---

## Twitter/X Hooks

### Platform Characteristics

- **Text-first**: Written hooks dominate
- **Thread culture**: Opening tweet determines all
- **Quote-tweet exposure**: Controversial takes spread
- **Rapid consumption**: Seconds per post

### Twitter Hook Rules

**Rule 1: First line is everything**
Everything after the first line is "below the fold":
```
❌ "I want to share some thoughts about AI tools. After using them
    for a while, I've realized that..."

✅ "AI coding tools are backwards.

    Here's what actually works:"
```

**Rule 2: Curiosity gaps work**
Create need to click "see more":
```
"I stopped using [tool] after 3 years.

The replacement is embarrassing."
```

**Rule 3: Lists need payoff**
If you promise a list, deliver:
```
"5 AI features that 10x'd my productivity:

1. [Specific feature]
2. ..."
```

**Rule 4: Controversy with receipts**
Hot takes need evidence:
```
"Unpopular opinion: [Claim]

Proof: [Evidence or experience]"
```

### Twitter Hook Templates

```
"[Hot take].

Here's why:"

"Stop [doing thing].

Start [doing better thing]."

"[Number] [things] I learned from [experience]:"

"[Bold claim].

And I have the data to prove it."

"[Question everyone wonders]?

After [experience], here's what I found:"
```

### OrchestKit for Twitter

```
"I stopped writing individual prompts.

Now I invoke skills.

The difference: 163 battle-tested patterns vs. making it up each time."

"Your AI assistant is goldfish-brained.

Mine remembers decisions from 6 months ago.

Here's how: 🧵"

"6 parallel AI agents.
1 command.
30 seconds.

Watch my PR get reviewed: [video]"
```

## Hook + Thumbnail Synergy (YouTube)

### The Tension Pair

Thumbnail creates question. Hook answers it.

**Example 1: Curiosity pair**
- Thumbnail: Shocked face + "I Was WRONG"
- Hook: "For 3 years I thought [belief]. I was completely wrong."

**Example 2: Transformation pair**
- Thumbnail: Before/After split
- Hook: "Same codebase. Same team. Completely different results."

**Example 3: Controversy pair**
- Thumbnail: "[Popular Tool] is DEAD"
- Hook: "I used [tool] for 5 years. Last month, I deleted it."

### Thumbnail Elements That Work

| Element | Impact | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Faces with expressions | High | Shock, confusion, excitement |
| Before/After | High | Split screen comparisons |
| Numbers | Medium | "47x Faster", "3 Steps" |
| Contrast text | Medium | Red "WRONG" vs Green "RIGHT" |
| Arrows/Circles | Low-Medium | Pointing to key elements |

### OrchestKit Thumbnail Ideas

```
Thumbnail: Face + "163 Skills?!"
Hook: "I discovered a Claude plugin with 163 specialized skills. Here's the 5 that matter."

Thumbnail: Before (chaos code) / After (clean)
Hook: "Same PR. Before and after AI review. The difference is embarrassing."

Thumbnail: "I Replaced [Tool Stack]"
Hook: "7 tools I stopped paying for after installing one plugin."
```

30-60s: Expansion (if warranted)
```

### YouTube Shorts Pacing
```
0-2s:   Hook (stop the scroll)
2-5s:   Promise (what you'll learn)
5-45s:  Content (deliver value)
45-60s: CTA (subscribe, part 2)
```

### YouTube Long-Form Pacing
```
0-5s:    Hook 1 (attention grab)
5-30s:   Hook 2 (preview + credibility)
30-60s:  Roadmap (what's coming)
1-12min: Content (with retention hooks)
Final:   CTA (subscribe, related videos)
```

### LinkedIn Pacing
```
0-2s:   Visual hook (text overlay)

## Cross-Platform Strategy

### Content Repurposing

1. **Create long-form first** (YouTube)
2. **Extract hooks for short-form** (TikTok, Shorts)
3. **Write insights for text platforms** (LinkedIn, Twitter)
4. **Use best performers as thumbnails/hooks**

### Hook Testing Flow

1. Test hooks on TikTok (fastest feedback)
2. Winners become YouTube Shorts
3. Top performers inform long-form hooks
4. Insights become LinkedIn/Twitter content
