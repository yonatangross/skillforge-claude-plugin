# Hook Patterns Deep Dive

Comprehensive analysis of each hook pattern with psychology, variations, and advanced techniques.

---

## Pattern Psychology

Understanding why hooks work helps you create better ones.

### The Curiosity Gap

Humans are wired to close open loops. Effective hooks create gaps that demand closure:

- **Information gap**: "The feature most developers don't know exists"
- **Outcome gap**: "What happened next surprised everyone"
- **Transformation gap**: "Before I discovered this, I was struggling"

### The Pattern Interrupt

Scrolling is automatic. Hooks must interrupt the pattern:

- **Unexpected visuals**: Code that looks wrong, unusual UI
- **Contradictions**: "The worst advice that actually works"
- **Specificity**: Concrete numbers break vague scrolling patterns

### The Identity Hook

People stop for content that reflects who they are or want to be:

- **Tribal**: "Every senior developer knows this"
- **Aspirational**: "How 10x engineers actually think"
- **Relatable**: "POV: You're debugging at 2am again"

---

## Pattern 1: Shocking Statistic (Extended)

### Variations

**The Industry Stat**:
```
"72% of production bugs come from one source"
"Only 12% of teams actually do code review right"
```

**The Personal Stat**:
```
"I spent 340 hours last year on this one task"
"My team caught 0 bugs in 6 months of manual review"
```

**The Comparison Stat**:
```
"90% of developers use X. Top 1% use Y."
"The average dev spends 4 hours debugging. I spend 20 minutes."
```

### Making Stats Work

**Source your stats** (or qualify them):
- "According to GitHub's research..."
- "In my experience with 50+ teams..."
- "Based on my last 1000 commits..."

**Make them visual**:
- Show the number on screen
- Use graphics/charts
- Let the number sink in (pause)

### OrchestKit Examples

```
"163 skills. 144 hooks. Zero config."
"I replaced 7 tools with one plugin"
"1 command. 6 parallel agents. 30 seconds."
```

---

## Pattern 2: Transformation Hook (Extended)

### The 3-Part Formula

```
[Before State] → [Catalyst] → [After State]
```

**Before State** (relatable pain):
- "I was drowning in manual testing"
- "Every PR review took 2 hours"
- "I kept making the same mistakes"

**Catalyst** (the discovery):
- "Then I found this one pattern"
- "Until I tried this approach"
- "Everything changed when I..."

**After State** (desirable outcome):
- "Now I ship with confidence"
- "My reviews take 10 minutes"
- "I haven't seen that error in months"

### Variations

**The Compressed Transformation**:
```
"From 50 errors to zero in one command"
"Chaos to clean architecture in 20 minutes"
```

**The Time-Boxed Transformation**:
```
"What took me 3 years to learn, in 3 minutes"
"The 6-month journey I wish I'd done in a week"
```

**The Before/After Split Screen**:
Visual transformation showing:
- Old workflow → New workflow
- Messy code → Clean code
- Error logs → Clean logs

### OrchestKit Examples

```
"From 'works on my machine' to reliable deploys"
"My debugging went from guessing to systematic"
"Zero to production-ready with AI assistance"
```

---

## Pattern 3: Contrarian Statement (Extended)

### The Controversy Spectrum

**Level 1 - Mild Challenge**:
```
"There's a better way to do code reviews"
"Most developers overcomplicate testing"
```

**Level 2 - Industry Pushback**:
```
"TDD is overrated for most teams"
"Clean code isn't always the goal"
```

**Level 3 - Direct Attack**:
```
"Stop using [popular tool]. Here's why."
"[Common practice] is actively hurting your code"
```

### Safety Guidelines

- **Back it up**: Contrarian claims need strong evidence
- **Qualify when needed**: "For most teams..." or "In my experience..."
- **Attack ideas, not people**: Focus on practices, not practitioners

### The "Actually, No" Formula

```
"Everyone says [common advice]. Actually, [opposite/nuanced take]."
```

Examples:
```
"Everyone says write tests first. Actually, that's backwards for prototypes."
"Common wisdom is more code = more bugs. Actually, it's about churn rate."
```

### OrchestKit Examples

```
"Stop writing prompts. Start using skills."
"AI assistants are useless. AI agents are game-changers."
"More tools isn't the answer. Orchestration is."
```

---

## Pattern 4: Direct Question (Extended)

### Question Types

**Pain Point Questions** (acknowledge suffering):
```
"Why does every deployment feel like Russian roulette?"
"Is anyone else tired of PR review back-and-forth?"
```

**Curiosity Questions** (spark investigation):
```
"What if your AI actually understood your codebase?"
"How do top teams ship so fast without breaking things?"
```

**Challenge Questions** (prompt self-reflection):
```
"When was the last time you felt confident shipping?"
"How much of your day is actually spent coding?"
```

### The Rhetorical Hook

Questions that don't expect answers but create engagement:

```
"Why are we still doing this manually in 2024?"
"Isn't it time we fixed this for good?"
```

### OrchestKit Examples

```
"What if your AI assistant never lost context?"
"Why are you still writing boilerplate tests?"
"What would you build if debugging was instant?"
```

---

## Pattern 5: "Stop Doing This" (Extended)

### The Warning Formula

```
"Stop [common action]. It's [consequence]. Do [alternative] instead."
```

### Intensity Variations

**Gentle Warning**:
```
"You might want to rethink how you're doing X"
"There's a better approach than X"
```

**Direct Warning**:
```
"Stop doing X immediately"
"X is costing you more than you think"
```

**Urgent Warning**:
```
"If you're still doing X, stop now"
"X is breaking your [important thing]"
```

### The Mistake Reveal

```
"I made this mistake for years. Don't be me."
"This small habit was killing my productivity."
```

### OrchestKit Examples

```
"Stop writing prompts from scratch every time"
"Stop context-switching between 10 different AI tools"
"Stop reviewing PRs without automated security checks"
```

---

## Pattern 6: Secret/Hidden (Extended)

### The Insider Formula

```
"The [hidden] [thing] that [elite group] uses"
```

### Legitimacy Factors

To avoid clickbait feel, add legitimacy:

- **Specificity**: "The 3-line config that changes everything"
- **Source**: "From the creator of [tool]"
- **Evidence**: "I tested this on 10 projects"

### Variations

**The Buried Feature**:
```
"This feature has been in [tool] for years. Nobody uses it."
"Hidden in the settings: the option that 10x'd my workflow"
```

**The Expert Secret**:
```
"What senior engineers actually do (that tutorials skip)"
"The debugging approach I learned at [respected company]"
```

**The Accidental Discovery**:
```
"I found this by accident. It changed everything."
"Stumbled onto this config. Wish I'd known sooner."
```

### OrchestKit Examples

```
"The hidden agent that writes your tests for you"
"A skill that exists but isn't in the docs"
"The Claude feature even power users miss"
```

---

## Pattern 7: "Most People" (Extended)

### The Positioning Formula

```
"Most [group] [do wrong thing]. [Smart/successful group] [do right thing]."
```

This creates:
- Relatability (most people = common)
- Aspiration (be different)
- Curiosity (what's the difference?)

### Variations

**The Majority Mistake**:
```
"95% of developers don't know this command exists"
"Most teams skip this step. It costs them weeks."
```

**The Elite Difference**:
```
"What separates good developers from great ones"
"The one habit of highly productive engineers"
```

**The "You're Probably" Hook**:
```
"You're probably making this mistake too"
"If you're like most devs, you're missing this"
```

### OrchestKit Examples

```
"Most devs prompt. Power users use skills."
"Most AI tools forget context. This one remembers."
"Most plugins do one thing. This orchestrates everything."
```

## Pattern 8: Countdown/List (Extended)

### Number Psychology

| Number | Perception | Best For |
|--------|------------|----------|
| 1 | Focused, essential | Core insights |
| 3 | Complete, memorable | Key principles |
| 5 | Comprehensive but digestible | How-tos |
| 7 | Authoritative | Deep dives |
| 10+ | Exhaustive | Reference content |

### List Variations

**The Essentials List**:
```
"5 things every [role] should know about [topic]"
```

**The Mistakes List**:
```
"7 errors killing your [process/code/workflow]"
```

**The Replacement List**:
```
"3 commands that replaced 10 tools"
```

**The Timeline List**:
```
"5 things I wish I knew 5 years ago"
```

### OrchestKit Examples

```
"6 agents running in parallel. One command."
"163 skills. Here are the 5 you need first."
"7 hooks that prevent my most common mistakes"
```

---

## Pattern 9: Story Hook (Extended)

### The Story Formula

```
[Time Marker] + [Stakes] + [Tension] + [Implied Outcome]
```

### Opening Variations

**The Crisis Opening**:
```
"2am. Production is down. And it's my fault."
"Friday afternoon. The demo is in an hour. Nothing works."
```

**The Discovery Opening**:
```
"Three months ago, I found something that changed how I code."
"I stumbled onto this pattern. I can't go back."
```

**The Challenge Opening**:
```
"They said it couldn't be done. I proved them wrong."
"Everyone on the team had given up. I kept going."
```

### Building Tension

- Use short sentences for urgency
- Add sensory details
- Create clear stakes

### OrchestKit Examples

```
"Last week, I shipped a feature in 30 minutes that usually takes 3 days."
"A client asked for the impossible. AI agents delivered."
"My lead said code review was pointless. This tool changed his mind."
```

---

## Pattern 10: "What If" (Extended)

### The Vision Formula

```
"What if [current pain] was actually [desirable state]?"
```

### Variations

**The Pain Inversion**:
```
"What if debugging was actually... fun?"
"What if code review created value instead of conflict?"
```

**The Possibility Question**:
```
"What if you could ship twice as fast, safely?"
"What if AI actually understood your intent?"
```

**The Future Glimpse**:
```
"This is what coding looks like in 2025"
"The future of development is already here"
```

### OrchestKit Examples

```
"What if your AI assistant had 163 specialized skills?"
"What if every PR came with security analysis built in?"
"What if AI could brainstorm, implement, and test for you?"
```

---

## Pattern 11: Challenge Hook (Extended)

### The Experiment Formula

```
"I [challenged myself to / tried] [difficult/interesting thing] for [time period]"
```

### Variations

**The Self-Experiment**:
```
"I used only AI to code for a month"
"I switched to [tool] for a week. Here's what happened."
```

**The Constraint Challenge**:
```
"I built an app with zero manual testing"
"I wrote a feature without reading the docs"
```

**The Comparison Challenge**:
```
"I tried [Tool A] vs [Tool B] for 30 days"
"Same feature, two approaches. Clear winner."
```

### OrchestKit Examples

```
"I let AI agents handle my entire PR workflow"
"I used every OrchestKit skill in one project"
"I challenged myself to ship without writing tests manually"
```

---

## Pattern 12: Authority Hook (Extended)

### The Credibility Formula

```
"[Credential/Achievement] taught me [non-obvious insight]"
```

### Credential Types

**Experience-Based**:
```
"After 10 years of debugging..."
"1000+ code reviews later..."
```

**Achievement-Based**:
```
"Building [notable project] taught me..."
"After [impressive metric]..."
```

**Position-Based**:
```
"As a [respected role] at [respected company]..."
"Leading a team of [X] engineers..."
```

### Humble Authority

Balance confidence with humility:

```
"I've made every mistake so you don't have to"
"It took me years to learn what I'm about to show you in minutes"
```

### OrchestKit Examples

```
"After building 100+ AI tools, I learned one thing..."
"Thousands of automated reviews taught me this pattern"
"Creating 163 skills revealed what developers actually need"
```

---

## Combining Patterns

### Pattern Stacking

Combine 2-3 patterns for stronger hooks:

**Statistic + Question**:
```
"90% of devs waste 4 hours a week on this. Are you one of them?"
```

**Contrarian + Story**:
```
"I used to think tests were essential. Then this happened..."
```

**Secret + List**:
```
"3 hidden features that senior developers don't share"
```

**Transformation + Authority**:
```
"After 1000 code reviews, I found the pattern that cut my time by 80%"
```

### The Compound Hook

Layer multiple curiosity triggers:

```
"[Statistic] And it's not what you think. [Contrarian hint]"
"[Question] The answer surprised me. [Story hint]"
```
