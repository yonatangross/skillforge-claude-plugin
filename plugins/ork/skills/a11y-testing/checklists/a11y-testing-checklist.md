# Accessibility Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure comprehensive accessibility coverage.

## Automated Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (jest-axe)

- [ ] All form components tested with axe
- [ ] All interactive components (buttons, links, modals) tested
- [ ] Custom UI widgets tested (date pickers, dropdowns, sliders)
- [ ] Dynamic content updates tested
- [ ] Error states tested for proper announcements
- [ ] Loading states have appropriate ARIA attributes
- [ ] Tests cover WCAG 2.1 Level AA tags minimum
- [ ] No disabled rules without documented justification

### E2E Tests (Playwright + axe-core)

- [ ] Homepage scanned for violations
- [ ] All critical user journeys include a11y scan
- [ ] Post-interaction states scanned (after form submit, modal open)
- [ ] Multi-step flows tested (signup, checkout, settings)
- [ ] Error pages and 404s tested
- [ ] Third-party widgets excluded from scan if necessary
- [ ] Tests run in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Accessibility reports archived on failure

### CI/CD Integration

- [ ] Accessibility tests run on every PR
- [ ] Pre-commit hook runs a11y tests on changed files
- [ ] Lighthouse CI monitors accessibility score (>95%)
- [ ] Failed tests block deployment
- [ ] Test results published to team (GitHub comments, Slack)

### Screen Reader Testing

Test with at least one screen reader:

#### Content Structure

- [ ] **Headings**
  - [ ] Logical heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, no skips)

  - [ ] Navigation uses `<ul>` or `<nav>`
  - [ ] Related items grouped in lists
  - [ ] Screen reader announces list with item count

#### Interactive Elements

- [ ] **Forms**
  - [ ] All inputs have associated `<label>` or `aria-label`
  - [ ] Required fields announced as required

  - [ ] Arrow keys navigate menu items
  - [ ] First/last items wrap or stop appropriately
  - [ ] Escape closes menu

- [ ] **Modals/Dialogs**
  - [ ] Focus moves to modal on open
  - [ ] Focus trapped within modal
  - [ ] Modal title announced
  - [ ] Escape closes modal
  - [ ] Focus returns to trigger on close

- [ ] **Tabs**
  - [ ] Tab role announced
  - [ ] Active tab announced as selected
  - [ ] Arrow keys navigate tabs
  - [ ] Tab panel content announced

### Color and Contrast

Use browser extensions (axe DevTools, WAVE) or online tools:

- [ ] **Text Contrast**
  - [ ] Normal text (< 18pt): 4.5:1 minimum ratio
  - [ ] Large text (≥ 18pt or 14pt bold): 3:1 minimum ratio
  - [ ] Passes for all text (body, headings, labels, placeholders)

- [ ] **UI Component Contrast**
  - [ ] Buttons, inputs, icons: 3:1 minimum against background
  - [ ] Focus indicators: 3:1 minimum
  - [ ] Error/success states: 3:1 minimum

- [ ] **Color Independence**
  - [ ] Information not conveyed by color alone

## Quick Wins for Common Issues

### Missing Alt Text
```html
<!-- Before -->
<img src="logo.png">

<!-- After -->
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
```

### Unlabeled Form Input
```html
<!-- Before -->
<input type="email" placeholder="Email">

<!-- After -->
<label for="email">Email</label>
<input type="email" id="email">
```

### Low Contrast Text
```css
/* Before */
color: #999; /* 2.8:1 ratio */

/* After */
color: #767676; /* 4.5:1 ratio */
```

### Keyboard Trap
```jsx
// Before
<div onClick={handleClick}>Click me</div>

// After
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
```

### Missing Focus Indicator
```css
/* Before */
button:focus { outline: none; }

/* After */
button:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```
