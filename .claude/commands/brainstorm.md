# Brainstorm: $ARGUMENTS

Deep exploration using 14-16 parallel agents with system design first approach.

> **📋 OUTPUT POLICY**: All agents follow `.claude/policies/agent-output-policy.md`
> - Tier 1 (Default): Return analysis inline - NO file creation
> - Tier 3 (Patterns): Only with explicit user approval
> - Tier 4 (Decisions): Update shared-context.json after synthesis

## Phase 0: System Design Interrogation (NEW)

**Before exploring solutions, ask the right questions.**

### 0a. Load System Design Skills

```python
# Load skills for structured thinking
Read(".claude/skills/system-design-interrogation/capabilities.json")
Read(".claude/skills/system-design-interrogation/checklists/before-implementation.md")
```

### 0b. Five-Dimension Quick Assessment

Run these questions BEFORE any implementation thinking:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SYSTEM DESIGN INTERROGATION                                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  □ SCALE     How many users? Data volume? Growth?           │
│  □ DATA      Where stored? Access pattern? Search needs?    │
│  □ SECURITY  Who can access? Tenant isolation? Attacks?     │
│  □ UX        Latency target? Feedback? Error handling?      │
│  □ COHERENCE Types across layers? Contracts? Breaking?      │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```python
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking(
  thought="""SYSTEM DESIGN INTERROGATION for: $ARGUMENTS

  SCALE:
  - How many users will use this?
  - What's the expected data volume?
  - What's the read/write ratio?

  DATA:
  - Where does this data naturally belong?
  - What's the primary access pattern?
  - Is search capability needed?

  SECURITY:
  - Who can access this?
  - How is tenant isolation enforced?
  - What attack vectors exist?

  UX:
  - What's the acceptable latency?
  - What feedback does the user need?
  - What happens on failure?

  COHERENCE:
  - Which layers does this touch?
  - What types/contracts change?
  - Is this a breaking change?""",
  thoughtNumber=1,
  totalThoughts=5,
  nextThoughtNeeded=true
)
```

## Phase 1: Initial Exploration (Sequential-Thinking MCP)

### 1a. Define the Problem Space

Use sequential-thinking for structured decomposition:

```python
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking(
  thought="Exploring the problem space for: $ARGUMENTS",
  thoughtNumber=1,
  totalThoughts=7,
  nextThoughtNeeded=true
)
```

Key questions to answer:
- What problem are we solving?
- Who are the users?
- What constraints exist?
- What's already been tried?

### 1b. Load Brainstorming Skill

```python
Read(".claude/skills/brainstorming/capabilities.json")
Read(".claude/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md")  # Full Socratic method
```

## Phase 2: Research & Context

### 2a. Web Search for Industry Solutions

```python
# PARALLEL - All searches in one message!
WebSearch("$ARGUMENTS best practices December 2025")
WebSearch("$ARGUMENTS industry solutions 2025")
WebSearch("$ARGUMENTS common pitfalls 2025")
WebSearch("$ARGUMENTS security considerations 2025")
WebSearch("$ARGUMENTS scalability patterns 2025")
```

### 2b. Memory MCP - Previous Brainstorms

```python
mcp__memory__search_nodes(query="brainstorm")
mcp__memory__search_nodes(query="design decisions")
mcp__memory__search_nodes(query="$ARGUMENTS")
```

### 2c. Context7 for Technical Possibilities

```python
# Look up relevant technologies
mcp__context7__get-library-docs(context7CompatibleLibraryID="/facebook/react", topic="patterns")
mcp__context7__get-library-docs(context7CompatibleLibraryID="/tiangolo/fastapi", topic="advanced")
```

## Phase 3: Multi-Perspective Analysis (12 Parallel Agents)

**Wait for all 12 to complete.**

## Phase 4: Synthesis & Coherence Review (3 Agents)

After collecting all perspectives, synthesize with coherence check:

```

## Phase 5: Interactive Refinement

Present findings to user with structured options:

```python

    "options": [
      {"label": "MVP First", "description": "Ship minimal version quickly, iterate"},
      {"label": "Full Build", "description": "Complete implementation upfront"},
      {"label": "Spike First", "description": "Technical proof-of-concept first"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  },
  {

```

## Phase 6: Save Brainstorm to Memory

```python

  "entityType": "brainstorm-session",
  "observations": [
    "Topic: $ARGUMENTS",
    "Key decision: ...",
